My only concern is what if the converse if possible? What if a cyber criminal could use neural networks as a method to "break" these programs? Also, there are elements of software testing which involves interpreting natural language and building test cases, which may be far off yet. At the very least, it demonstrates the potential of neural networks.

The algorithm can learn what story the journalist is researching and so can look more relevant data the more it is used. ~The algorithm is already making journalists jobs much easier, but it struggles with the context of different words. For example, it struggles to identify the contextual difference  of 'Washington' in Denzel Washington and The Washington Post. ~The tool is already working in that aspects of journalist's jobs are being being made less  menial and so they can work on other news stories, thus improving the overall quality of news. Once the tool can be taught contextual differences, it will become even better and could have uses in academia and law as a tool for researching.

They take part in publishing papers and educational articles in the areas of mathematical, physical and engineering sciences for educational purposes. ~To introduce the Gaussian processes for time-series data analysis and the conceptual framework of Bayesian modelling in this filed. Bayesian modelling for time-series data is discussed in this paper and the foundations of Bayesian non-parametric modelling are presented for Gaussian processes. ~The authors used knowledge they have learned and developed in the area of Gaussian processess to suggest new equations, formulas and ways of implementing algorithms to further improve the study of machine learning. The time-series analysis was casted into the format of a regression problem, in the form y(x)=f(x)+n, where f() is an unknown function and n is an additive noise process. Covariance algoriths were then carried out to collect data on Gaussian processing data. Graphs were drawn to show the result of the algorithms nad how they had an effect on Gaussian processing information. ~Covariance functions-How they formulate a covariance over arbitary large sets. The domain and knowledge influences design of Gaussian process models are discussed which help provide case exmaples to highlight what should be apporached and what shouldn't in the area of Gaussian process model advancement. ~This paper concludes by presenting a short outline of conceptual nad mathematical basis of GP modelling of time series. The possibilities of further extensions using GPs as cornerstones for further research into this field are discovered to have more complex probalistic models, where the authors noted that more research in this area is possible for numerical intergration, global optimization and much more advancement opportunities in the area of machine learning. ~This paper was interesting as the authors delved into retying to discorver algorithms to further improve covariance functions and how to improve them in the area of machine learning, Should further studies in this continue, Gaussian processess for time-series data analysis could be significantly be improved by further more robust, efficient and faster computing algorithms, to enchance the area of study in machine learning globally.

METHOD To create counterfeit videos face tracking and lip tracking were used to overlay the false lip movements on top of the legitimate video. To create predicted sounds the silent video was compared with a database of videos with sound and the best match was played. The detection of fake handbags simply compared an image set of fake handbags with those taken by the user. A handwriting database was also used to create false signatures. ~All cases were successful, the video produced were very realistic but the recreated face movements and sound. The counterfeit handbag detection was also successful. ~This article points to the very real danger that machine learning techniques can be used to create convincing fake videos and documents. However it also highlights the fact that these same techniques can be used to detect and prevent counterfeiting.

The area under an ROC curve metric does not require me to know in advance where I will set the threshold for identifying players at risk of injury. ~Four random players were picked and an injury scores was calculated for each game in the season they got injured. All four  displayed high injury scores leading up to the injury; with some showing a very sharp uptick in potential injury just prior to the injury. Some other players had similar but mildly noisier trends, while the remaining player had a consistently high injury score. Whether the final player was that prone to injury permenently or it was a culmination of a lot of games with potential injury was not clear. ~This study was designed to be usable by coaches or athletes as a tool to help identify potential injury patterns, so the results were correlated into an easily usable tool.

This particular field is important as it helps discover whether or not there is structure in your problem for the algorithms to learn and which algorithms are effective. This reduces the time used in fine tuning the algorithms, in order to make good predictions. In this scenario we run a learning algorithm over a dataset with different settings which will return to us different models and the goal is to pick the best performing models. Due to this reason, the need to estimate the respective performance in order to rank the models against each other is required. ~The data used in this paper can be viewed via this archive. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ~There are several different approaches to evaluating models. Cross validation is a method of model validation which is generally better than residual. In cross validation we get an indication of how well the algorithm will work when presented with data it has not seen before. One way of resolving this problem is by splitting the training data into two (training around 2/3 and testing around 1/3). This is known as the holdout method. A function approximator fits a particular function using the training set present only. After this, then its asked to predict the output values in the testing set. The main objective is that it has never seen these values before and so it should give us an unbiased estimate of its performance on new unseen data.  The fraction of the correct predictions constitutes our estimate of the prediction accuracy and because we can see how it generalises to the unseen test data we can conclude that the predictions weren't memorized.  ~The main results are as follows, the iris dataset which containsof 50 Setosa , 50 versicolor  and 550 virginica flowers, the data is divided into  the training set two thirds (which is 100) and the testing set one third (which is 50).  The beneficial advantage of this method is that it better than residual method and no longer to compute. The evaluation may depend highly on which data points end up in the training sets and which end up in the test set. For instance looking at our iris data set assuming that the flowers are distributed uniformly in nature, by splitting the data into training and testing sets we introduced an imbalance in the two datasets. In this case we are running and evaluating the model with imbalanced data, which could cause problems with the data analysis. ~I found it interesting that Machine learning can be used to identify patterns in regards to things in nature, such as that of the flower used in this research paper. This shows how vast and versatile machine learning can be, as well as its wide applicability around various scenarios in the modern, changing and fast IT evolving world of today.

The neural network learns based on how words are used so it is less effected by variations in spelling or slang. ~ This algorithm works very successfully as you can have a conversation with some people on facebook about a product or service and then later see in a sidebar an advertisement for a similar product or service. ~ Facebook has become a goldmine of user data and reguarly suggest pages and products to users based on conversations they have been having. This can then direct them to websites like amazon which employ their own algorithms come up with more recomendations. 
471 ~175 ~Sebastian Raschka, model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in Machine learning https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html ~Sebastian Raschka a machine learning aficianado and a data analyst  GOAL	 Evaluating the performance of machine learning model is important as it helps discover whether or not there is structure in your problem for the algorithms to learn and which algorithms are effective.  This reduces the time used in fine tuning the algorithms, in order to make good predictions.  In this scenario we run a learning algorithm over a dataset with different settings which will return to us different models and the goal is to pick the best performing models. For this reason we need to estimate the respective performance in order to rank the models against each other. ~The iris dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ~There are different approaches to evaluating models. Cross validation is a method of model validation which is generally better than residual.  In cross validation we get an indication of how well the algorithm will work when presented with data it has not seen before.  One way of solving this problem is to split the training data into two (training ~2/3 and testing ~1/3). This is called the holdout method.  The function approximator fits a function using the training set only. It is then asked to predict the output values in the testing set.  The idea is that it has never seen these values before and so it should give us an unbiased estimate of its performance on new unseen data.   The fraction of the correct predictions constitutes our estimate of the prediction accuracy and because we can see how it generalises to the unseen test data we can conclude that the predictions were not memorized.  ~Using the Iris dataset which consists of 50 Setosa , 50 versicolor  and 550 virginica flowers, the data is divided into  the training set 2/3 (100) and the testing set 1/3 (50).  The advantage of this method is that it better than residual method and no longer to compute. The evaluation may depend highly on which data points end up in the training sets and which end up in the test set.  For instance looking at our iris data set assuming that the flowers are distributed uniformly in nature, by splitting the data into training and testing sets we introduced an imbalance in the two datasets. In this case we are running and evaluating the model with imbalanced data. ~with many bussinesses turning to machine learnig, its improtant that the predictions made by the algorithms are accurate.  this article is interesing as it points out the importance of having good models to train our algorithms.  both methods inroduced in this article point out important topics that need to be considered when training the algoriths.

The images were 216x256 pixes in size. ~Yee applied affine transformations to the data, such as random rotations, translations, zooms and shears, as well as elastic deformations, which locally stretch and compress the image. This was used to force the network to learn that the RV is a solid, crescent-shaped object that can appear in a variety of orientations. Also, to quantify model performance, Yee used the dice coefficient, which compares a mask X delineating what it thinks is the RV with a mask Y produced by a physician. ~Using these machine learning methods, Yee was able to create models that achieve state of the art segmenting of the right ventricle in cardiac MRIs. ~I feel that the model built here by Yee is important in the advancement of medicine and detecting disease. If it can be implemented into other areas of medicine, it would be of great benefit to the medical community and just shows how important machine learning can be to society.

It was creted by a company called DeepMind that were later acquired by Google's parent company AlphaBet. ~The goal here was to beat China's leading player at the ancient game of Go. It had in the past 18 months beaten South Korea's and at the time the World'ls leading player in the game of Go. Shock waves had been felt in China when AphaGo had beaten Mr Lee of South Korea and now there was a new challenger in Mr Ke of China.  ~The data is the game of Go and what possible moves can be made. AlphaGo is a deep learning Neural Network that has been able to learn the game of Go as it plays. The reason they chose the game Go is because even our best super computers at present could not caclculate all of the moves possible within this game and so a brute force approach is most definitely impossible. The data here is always growing as AlphaGo is always updating its strategy as it learns from each game.  ~The method here is essentially AlphaGo and they way it learns is by using convolutional neural networks. It is considered deep learning because it has many layers, 13 to be exact. It learns in a supervised manner. It relies on 2 different components one being the convolutional networks and the tree search proceedure. "The tree search procedure can be regarded as a brute-force approach, whereas the convolutional networks provide a level on intuition to the game-play." They also sometimes let the system play itself to further improve itself seeing as it has already beaten the best human players.  ~The result has been a great success, as it has inspired many people in China to invest alot more time and money into their own deep learning neural networks. "'AlphaGo truly had a big impact' in China, said Wang Shengjin, a professor at the department of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "Before, we would be discussing how to apply the technology, but it was hard to be clear exactly how to do it, so AlphaGo gave us a vivid example of that."  ~AlphaGo shook the machine learning World when it beat Mr Lee of South Korea and it has improved itself greatly since then. Adding more vibrations around the World by beating the Chinese champion Mr Ke. It seems to be going from strength to strenght and AlphaGo is only the beginning of the applications for this amazing software, the company DeepMind hopes that it will be ables to assist in curing disesase and illness and many more of humanities toughest challenges.

The researchers created a training set of 128,000 retinal images classified by at least three ophthalmologists. ~Using the deep learning technique, the researchers developed an algorithm to analyse retinal images. Once the algorithm was trained, using the training set of 128,000 retinal images, the researchers tested its performance on 12,000 images and found that it matched or exceeded the performance of experts in identifying the condition and grading its severity. ~In result, the researchers collaborated with scientists in India, where a clinical trial involving real patients is ongoing. This project involves patients receiving a normal consultation, but their images are also fed into the deep-learning system for comparison. According to Google, results from this trial are not yet ready for publication. ~In my opinion, I believe the use of machine learning in medicine is a great idea, especially for certain areas of the world where the lack of expertise is noticeable.

These hidden layers allow them to learn complicated relationships between their input and output. This strategy of learning requires a lot of data for with limited data the network will contain complicated relationship. During the training phase we randomly drop components of neural network (outputs) from a layer of neural networks. The strategy known as dropout is used to minimise over fitting.

Link for PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf ~Magenta, a Google Brain Project that fuses music and machine learning together. ~The data is from an "NSynth Dataset" that contains musical notes, which can be formatted in JSON or TFRecord files of serialised TensorFlow protocol buffers. The data is broken into 3 parts: Train - a training set of 289,205 examples. Instruments do not overlap with valid or test. Valid - a validation set with 12,678 examples. Instruments do not overlap with train. Test - A test set with 4,096 examples. Instruments do not overlap with train. They have feature encodings, note qualities, instrument classes & families. These come under the 3 pieces of information, source, quality and family. Family of what an instrument belongs to, sonic quality of notes and the source of the sound production of the image which can be acoustic, electronic or synthetic. The NSynth Dataset has 305,979 musical notes, each with a unique pitch, timbre, and envelope, 1,006 instruments from commercial sample libraries. METHOD The methods used here were recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-term short memory (LSTM) models. The RNN loops connections on the network to hold information across inputs. This is used to learn sequential data like music. The TensorFlow, open-source library software for Machine Intelligence. The recurrent connections in the graph are unrolled into a feed-forward network. The network is trained using a gradient descent technique called back-propagation through time. It predicts the next note given a set of the previous notes. This type is supervised because of the problem of melody generation, and helps predict the next note in a sequence. The way labels can be derived from a dataset of music. In terms of LSTM, you have 2 models, Lookback RNN and Attention RNN. The Lookback RNN has custom inputs and labels. The inputs allow the model to easily recognise patterns that would occur in 1 or 2 bars. Also recognised patterns in relation to where the event takes place and the labels make it easier for the model to repeat rather than have it stored in the RNN cell, which is an LSTM. If wanting to learn longer-term structures, the Attention RNN would be the solution. This model can access previous information without having to store it in the RNN cell, this cell also being an LSTM. This model looks at the last n steps when generating an output for the current step. ~This results in making a program that plays automatically off of the data set it was given with the use of RNN and LSTM. As well as giving a demonstration of neural audio synthesis. ~N/A.

Bitdefender doesn't fully rely on machine learning technology for detection, instead opting for a layered approach. Machine learning is an indispensable part of our technology security stack, not only by proactively and accurately identifying new and unknown threats, but also by augmenting the detection capabilities of those security technologies. ~Bitdefender has a portfolio of 72 patents in areas such as machine learning, anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-fraud, antimalware, virtualization, BOX-functionality and hardware design, including 42 delivered in the past three years, and 35 under examination. Ten percent of the patents apply to machine learning in malware detection and online threats, deep learning and anomaly-based detection techniques, strengthening Bitdefender's thought leadership positioning globally. ~Since 2009, the development and training of machine learning algorithms has been a key focus for Bitdefender Laboratories, proving extremely effective in detecting threats in a sophisticated, modern threat landscape. ~The experience of working with machine learning algorithms to detect new and unknown malware samples has substantially improved detection rates and reduced false positives. For Bitdefender, machine learning has proven the best method in data analysis, polymorphic and generic malware detection, among others. ~For Bitdefender, Machine Learning has really paved a way for it to offer the best possible protection to its users.

The same idea applies when a genuine is identified.  ~By using the same technology which looks at genuines and fakes and tries to make the fake look more like the genuine article, we can distinguish the fake from the genuine. The algorithms used to fake things can be counteractively used to identify the fakes. Such an application is forensics - where forensic analysis has been done solely by hand for a long time.

The weighted loss of its chosen path in comparison to the weight of its edges are summed up and calculated based on an algorithm for choosing a path effectively. ~Data acquired from the 'multi-armed bandit' case algorithm was studied. This data shows how the decision maker only has access to the loss of the chosen path upon request, where the total number of requests should be bounded by a certain constan 'm'. ~The method the authors used in this paper to evaluate their research is based on a model of the lab-efficient bandit problem for shortest paths, which is motivated by an application to a particular packet switched network model. This model was called the 'cognitive packet network'. These networks contained a type of packet called 'smart packets', which were used to explore the network effectively. These packets would query the delay in networks or loss of data in the network. ~In this paper, the authors have resulted in producing some efficient algorithms for this particular case. These algorithms have been provided for the multi-armed bandit setting and in a combined label efficient multi-armed bandit setting, provided the individual edge losses along the chosen path are revealed to the algorithms. The normalized regrets of the algorithms, compared to the performance of the best fixed path, converge to zero at an O(1/√n) rate as the time horizon n grows to infinity, and increases only polynomially in the number of edges (and vertices) of the graph. ~It is interesting to see how Machine Learning algorithms can be used to further improve and make further advancements into research that solves different cases in the area of shortest path decision making and its choice evaulation. This paper shows how efficient algorithms have been provided for the 'multi-bandit' case and provided methods and algorithms to improve the convergence rate significantly in comparision to other algorithms.

The customers are grouped by splitting them into clusters and assign the active customer to a specific cluster. This is done by assigning a vector to each customer. The vector contains data about each item and wether or not the user has interacted with it. The value is positive if the user bought or rated the item, negative if the user disliked the item or zero if the user has not interacted with the item. The clusters were then generated by initially having a random number of empty clusters and assign randomly selected customers to each. Then customers were assigned to clusters based on similarity. Sub algorithms ran during this time to split and merge clusters as they built up. ~ This provided a much more efficient way to quickly generate recomendations for users ~ Here the quality of the recomendations can be low as the purchases and ratings are averaged out in each cluster. Each customer is grouped with a large number of customers which means customers with more unique tastes will often get useless recomendations.

Training AI bots to negotiate https://code.facebook.com/posts/1686672014972296/deal-or-no-deal-training-ai-bots-to-negotiate/ ~Facebook ~To teach chat bots the ability to negotiate i.e. to train a bot to interact and achieve a goal faced with another entity with potentially opposing goals. Specifically, two dialog agents are shown a collection of items, for example 3 bananas, 2 apples and an orange. Each agent has a value function assigned to an item and neither knows the value functions of the other. The aim is for the bots to negotiate so that they both maximise the sum of the values they have assigned to each item.  ~The researchers in this case crowdsourced a collection of negotiations between pairs of people. The negotiation situation replicated that faced by the dialogue bots. The researchers hoped to build dialogue bots that would replicate the behaviour of humans that were successful in their negotiation. ~Dialogue Rollout: At each stage of the conversation, a chat bot would anticipate future resulting conversations that would occur as a result of choosing a certain negotiation tactic. Therefore at each opportunity the bot would take the route which it expected to deliver the highest return later in the negotiation. Recurrent Neural Network: Such a network was used to allow the dialogue bots to be trained to imitate the actions of human negotiators. We have already mentioned how layers in such neural networks maintain a sense of what has happened at previous layers.  Reinforcement Learning: The researchers had the model negotiate with itself also. The model was rewarded when the negotiation goal was achieved, otherwise, the model would be adjusted.  Supervised learning (Neural Networks) were used as a pre-training tactic to map between language and meaning, while reinforcement learning was then utilised in order to achieve the goal of the dialogue bot by choosing between one of the utterances provided by the neural network..  ~The most effective dialogue bot was then tested against humans. Interestingly, most people did not know that they were speaking to a bot when the tests were carried out online. At the same time, the dialogue bot was able to match human negotiators, achieving a better outcome as often as a worse outcome was achieved when compared to a person.  ~An interesting side-effect of the experiment was seeing bots develop their own language to communicate with each other. This raised the concerns of researchers and the public alike of the ability of artificial intelligence to make autonomous decisions, and the potential risks associated to humans.

598 ~177 ~This article was created by Sophia Ciocca and is available at hackernoon. https://hackernoon.com/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe ~The Agent here is "Discover Weekly", a feature from  music streaming company, Spotify that originated in Stockhom, Sweedenand was launched on 7 October 2008. ~The goal here is to create a solid music curation system that recognises each individuals tastes and produces a playlist of 30 songs each Monday for them. There have been music curation attempts made before by other companies such as "Beats", "Songza", "Pandora" and "last.fm" to name afew. Each implementing the own methods with varying degrees of success but none of them ever mastering it. Spotify's goal was to change that by implementing a couple different methods where it's predecessor's only implemented one method.  ~The data they use comes from their own data on their users and their songs. As they use more than one method to acheive their goal they use different types of data for each method. They have 140 million users Worldwide and they have 30 million songs in their database. They also use data from around the web to analyze blogs etc. to see what people are saying about particular artist's or songs. Finally they use indepth data from the audio file. ~The three methods they use are, Collaborative Filtering, Natural Language Processing and Raw Audio Models. With Collaborative Filtering they have a gigantic matrix with each user as a row and each column as a song. It then compares users e.g. user A and user B, and if they have similar tastes it will suggest the songs to user A, that it has not listened to but user B has and vice versa. The NLP method uses words from track metadata, news articles, blogs and other text around the web. Although how exactly they process this data is not known, if it is similar to "Echo Nest", then it groups top terms associated with artists/songs and adds a weight to each term. It then suggests new tracks to users based on the terms. Now comes probably their most important method. Creating Raw Audio Models so comparisons can be done between the audio metadata of the files. This method uses a Convolutional Neural Network similar to the ones that do face recognition although it has been modified to deal with audio data. This method is particularly effective as it means "Discover Weekly" can have songs from artist's that are not so popular. The previous two methods can easily oversee new artist's who have yet to have a surge in popularity and so this is probably the most inmportant method. Some of the characteristics it gets of a song are  key, mode, tempo, loudness and time signature. This can be compared to other tracks user A listens to and if similar can easily end up in user A's "Discover Weekly". ~As a user of Spotify and a big fan of "Discover Weekly", I personally think there results have been a big success. The songs that it puts into "Discover Weekly" are perfect for me and at times I have felt it knows me better than I know myself. The article itself explains how many previous users of Spotify have returned due to how accurate this feature is for and individuals tastes. This to me suggest it is a success and will continue to be as it grows. ~Spotify has many competitors in this space at the moment, like "iTunes" and "Tidal" to name afew. It is features like "Discover Weekly" that set it apart from the rest and keep its fans coming back for more.

Most of the global enterprises have cantered their corporate strategy on digital transformation. Forbes uses applications, algorithms and frameworks to gather information from a huge amount of structured and unstructured data such audio, visuals, texts, voice, body language and facial expression that occur. This developes room for a wider dimension of applications and algorithms ranging from healthcare to video games and even self-driving cars.  ~Using historical data, ML will help businesses grow by basing their decisions on business models with the best outcome.  ML will lead businesses into environmentss with minimum human error and stronger cyber security.ML will completely enable new interactions between customers and companies and eventually allow true intelligent enterprise. ~Historical data and information based on business models, data based on human error, business environments and cyber security. ~Even though machines can automate lengthy and repetitive tasks, thses machines also be used to predict the outcome of new data.  This predictive information data is used to determine and make decisions. Organisations heavily rely on suchpredictions to improve their businesses prospects and reduce the risk taken in decision making as it minimises human error. Behaviour signals in human beings heavily impact prediction algorithms. The more the user shares with the algorithm the better the prediction becomes, one example is streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon prime where, depending on the users behaviour, the platform can recommend and advertise content.  These algorithms define a strategy to drive desired sales and market outcomes. Business processes will also become automated and as the business changes these algorithms will constantly update and adapt themselves to the changes in business.  ~Machine Learning is improving enterpirses prospects according to most companies who are applying machine learning to sales, marketing and any relatable area of business in general where machine learning can be applied. With machine learning, companies are gaining a greater predictive accuracy. According to the Accenture institute of higher performance, seventy six percent of the companies that use machine learning claimed to be targeting a higher sales growth in the world of today. ~In the area of business, Machine Learning is highly useful in creating strong predictive algorithms, analysing user preferences, market research opportunies, competitor statistics and other significant areas of improvements. These all contribute to the benefit of improving enterprises in making them more accurate, successful and efficient in the world of business today.

433 ~88 ~https://www.teslarati.com/openai-self-play-dota-2-musk/ https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/ ~The article is reported by Mike Tolzer. The project itself was undertaken by OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company ~The goal of this project was to designed a bot for the popular video game DOTA 2. The aim was for this bot to learn how to play the game to such a degree that it could defeat the top-level players in the game, using self-play. ~OpenAI hypothesized that, for this project, supervised deep learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets. By using self-play as their data-set, the data would improved automatically as the agent gets better. ~OpenAI developed the bot in small, incremental steps. On March 1st, they began with classical reinforcement learning, where the bot 'kites' an enemy(Kiting is a strategy where a player with long-range attacks will fire at an enemy who has only melee-reach attacks, run away, fire, run away - repeating). Beyond simple strategies like this, OpenAI used only self-play with the bots. Agents undergoing self-play initially receive dense rewards for behaviours that aid exploration like standing and moving forward, which are eventually annealed to zero in favor of being rewarded for just winning and losing. The agents neural network is trained with Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms(PPO). This uses an adaptive Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to control the change of the policy at each iteration. ~The results of the agent were tracked using TrueSkill. TrueSkill is a skill-based ranking system developed by Microsoft. The graph representing this is gradual increase from the bots inception in April, to its last record play in August. In the month of August, the bot had a string of victories against top players, often in 3-0 wins. On the tenth of August it was due to face the top player, Sumail. The agent defeated Sumail 6-0, and Sumail remarked that the agent was unbeatable. The following day the agent faced Dendi, an old crowd-favourite, and defeated him 2-0. ~While creating and having the agent learn was an impressive feat in itself, what is much more impressive here is the rate at which the agent learned, and went on to defeat the top players in the world. Large DOTA 2 tournaments are often played in huge football stadiums with sell-out crowds, and the agent was brought to tournaments like this. It often used strategies that impressed crowds to the extent it illicited cheers and loud reactions. What impresses me about this is that the agent gives the appearence that it is not just playing like an optimal-route machine, but an ingenious player that utilises unseen tactics and lightning reactions.

The idea was an app called 'Not Hotdog'. The app would snap a picture of a piece food, and verify if it was a hotdog, or not a hotdog. The app was taken from fiction and made reality by a single developer involved in the show. While it may seem farcical at first, the overall process was a great example of how Machine Learning can be used. ~The goal here was to produce an app that could correctly identify a piece of food as either 'Hotdog' or 'Not Hotdog' ~The dataset used was quite varied. General images of hotdogs were used in varying situations - height/width, background, lighting conditions, cultural differences, perspective, composition, etc. Images that could attempt to 'fool' the neural network were also used - such as hamburgers, sandwiches etc. Aggressive data augmentation was used to counter the fact that not every image will be taken 'perfectly' eg Not every image will be snapped using a DSLR. The final dataset consisted of 150,000 images, of which 3000 were hotdogs.  ~The Keras implementation on TensorFlow was used for this project, along with Batch Normalization. This is is a technique to provide any layer in a Neural Network with inputs that are zero mean/unit variance. It activates of the previous layer at each batch, i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1. ~The agent is able to recognise the difference between hotdogs and non-hotdogs successfully. ~As previously mentioned, this exercise seems farcical and silly. However its implementation and extremely clear documentation provides an interesting exercise into the many applications of machine learning.

The individuals involved in this project was a joined team assembled from employees at DeepMind and Blizzard Entertainment. DeepMind is a leader in artifical intelligence who look to push boundaries by developing systems to solve complex problems. This has often lead them to the area of gaming, both traditional and video gaming. The company made headlines worldwide with its program AlphaGo, which defeated a human Go player. AlphaGo then went on to defeat Lee Sedol, the current world champion. Their parters in this project, Blizzard Entertainment, is a video game company founded in 1991. They have several popular titles, 'Starcraft 2' being the one this project is focused on. Starcraft 2 is a 'Real-Time-Strategy' game, which focuses on strategy, unit control, and quick reactions. It is a title that is ideally suited for a project like this.  ~The Goal of this projet was to introduce the StarCraft 2 Learning Environment(SC2LE), a reinforcement learning environment based on Starcraft 2. This allows Starcraft 2 to function as research environment. DeepMind recgonised Starcraft 2 was a suitable environment to teach computers advanced skills like memory and planning, and as such created the environment for the benefit of AI researchers. The packaged includes an API, which is essentially the core of the project, that allows the AI to play the game feed back data to the researchers ~The data supplied by Blizzard Entertainment has been from 'replays' of previous games by human players. These fall into two tiers: Novice, and Grandmaster. The Novice matches are between two human players of average skill, while the Grandmaster matches are between players involved in e-sports in a profressional manner. Besides for replays of matches, Blizzard have also provided data in the form of mini-games that isolate certain gameplay elements like map exploration and resource collection, which can be used to develop a particular skill. ~The project makes use of a relative new and popular Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. A3C was created by DeepMind and is the faster, simpler, and more robust successor to the Deep-Q-Network - which was also created by DeepMind. As the name suggests, A3C is Asynchronous, and as such launchs several agents(workers) and lets them all interact with their own instance of the environment. The number of workers launched is relative to the host machines CPU, and the more that are launched, the more data that can be collected in a smaller window. ~In comparing agents trained on 'novice' data and 'grandmaster' data, it was found the agents on the lower spectrum were unable to develop a meaningful strategy for a full-game (Of length 30 minutes). The most succesful agent of this grouping was one that avoided constant losses by essentially running away for the length of the game (To expand on this point; One of the selectable teams in the game are called 'Terran'. Terran are humans from the distant future, and have the ability to let their buildings fly. To avoid defeat, the agent would uproot his buildings as the opponent approached, and fly them away to another location). The other group of agents - those who learned from the 'grandmaster' data converged to trivial strategies that only avoided distracting worker units from mining minerals, thus maintaining a stable improvement in the score(There are many metrics which dictate the overall score of a game on its complemention, and overall mineral collection is one of them). Thus, the score of most agents converged to simply preserving the initial mining process without building further units or structures. ~I think this a very interesting project and it does have a lot of potential to bringing interest in Machine Learning to a wider group of indivduals. Given that e-sports like StarCraft 2 are part of a multi-billion dollar industry, further projects in this field could aid the spread of Machine Learning. I had initially expected the 'Grandmaster' agents to form a near-optimal game, but I was incorrect. StarCraft 2, given its complexities, may not yet be suitable for this sort of learning but it is a step in the right direction certainly, and as previously mentioned the topic has sparked a lot of conversation on forums where the topic of Machine Learning is largely unheard of.

When asked "How large are you?" or "What are your dimensions?", Alexa failed to understand. When asked "How tall is the Echo", Alexa was finally able to answer and other phrases like "How large is the Echo?" and "What are the dimensions of Echo?" were also successful. It turned out that adding the extra term "physical" to "dimensions" caused the algorithm to fail. ~To make Alexa work, Earley realised he had to use specific language to make the functions work. Even though he made a lot of mistakes, he eventually learned how to control the automation with his voice. ~I can see the benefits and excitement behind devices like Amazon Echo but I also understand that the importance of a good algorithm could make or break the product.

543 ~52 ~https://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/  ~The article was reported by Kevin Poulsen, while the learning in question was done by Chris McKinlay. McKinlay, at the time, was a mathematician undertaking his PhD. The title of his thesis was 'Large-scale data processing and parallel numerical methods'.  ~McKinlay was an avid user of dating websites, with limited success. In 2012, McKinlay was working on machine code, when he had the revelation that he could he was approaching one particular dating site - OkCupid - in the wrong manner. McKinlay decided to tackle the website in a mathematical manner, with the goal of boosting his successes on the website.  ~OkCupid at its heart is mathematical, having been found by Math majors from Harvard, and uses a computational approach to matchmaking. Upon signing up, and in regular intervals, users are asked multiple-choice questions on a range of data - politics, religion, family, general outlooks. On average a user will answer 350 questions, and OkCupids matching algorithms uses this data to calculate two peoples compatibility. The closer to 100% the match is, the more likely the two parties will interact well. In order to gather suitable data, McKinlay wrote a Python script. The script would use 12 fake OkCupid accounts to scrape all available information off their profiles, including ethnicity, height, smoker or nonsmoker, and astrological sign. Furthermore, McKinlay gathered information about the womens responses to their own question. After overcoming some data-mining hurdles, McKinlay had gathered 6 million questions and answers from 20,000 women across the USA - after 3 weeks.  ~McKinlay used the K-Modes algorithm to accurately survey the data. While K-Means is used for numerical data, k-modes came out of a paper in 1998 by Zhexue Huang and was designed with categorical data in mind. Instead of distances seen in K-Means, it uses dissimilarities(the quantification of the total mismatches between two objects - the smaller this number, the more similar the two objects). Furthermore, instead of using means, it uses modes. As with k-means, K-Modes will converge into suitable clusters. After McKinlay had crunched the data, he selected the cluster that suited him most - in this case it was women in their twenties, who looked like musicians and artistsm, and another cluster for slightly older women who had professional creative jobs. Following this, McKinlay created a profile and filled out 500 questions that were popular with both clusters. While he answered the questions honestly, he left the importance(users not only answer a question, but rate its importance to them personally) up to another algorithm called adaptive boosting. ~The experiment was without a doubt a mathematical success, with McKinlay getting 400 visits to his profile daily, and recieved a constant stream of messages. McKinlay did succeed in getting many dates, and as the summer came to closed he had been on 55, thanks to the his use of algorithms. Eventually McKinlays uses of machine learning algorithms found him a match, Tien Wang, to whom he is now engaged.  ~Though the article may seem somewhat trivial or maybe a little silly, I think it is a very practical and approachable piece on a practical use of machine learning. McKinlay used well known algorithms to great effect and ultimately 'cheated' the system and completed his goal.

"Its training allows it to find patterns and make connections between the food images and the corresponding ingredients and recipes". ~ The work is built off datasets including "The Food-101 Data Set" and a database from the City University in Hong Kong. Pic2Recipe uses training data from websites like All Recipes and Food.com, entitling the set "Recipe1M". This training set contains over 1 million recipes that are annotated with information about recipes and ingredients of a wide range of dishes.  ~ The neural network was then trained to find patterns and connections between images in Recipe1M. ~ Although Pic2Recipe proved to be quite good at performing its duties, it sometimes failed in identifying differences in obscure food items such as soups and smoothies. It also struggled with food items that had more than one recipe possibility.  Minor  adjustments were made to accommodate for a food item with multiple recipe options. This was done by cross-referencing ingredients, before continuing to check each possibly recipe. Future plans for Pic2Recipe include functionality that can determine the method of cooking from an image, and functionality that can specify an exact ingredient as opposed to a general class e.g. distinguish between a cherry tomato and a grape tomato. ~ The idea of computer vision and neural networks combining to create something that can analyse an image to such an extent, is quite an exciting one. The applications of this work could translate into a multiple of possibilities. The refining of Pic2Recipe and expansion on Recipe1M could make for big advances in the analysis of nutrition. From this we could learn about peoples' cooking and eating habits, standards in cooking and possibly learn from food in a cultural context. Tracking personal nutrition could also be a possible outcome; developing a mean of determining the nutrients and calories in a meal from an image.

(SSA) Such information could be used to support agricultural development in an area where over 50% of the world's potential land is available for cultivation yet only 9% is arable land and 1% permanently cultivated. ~ Input data of soil samples from 59,000 unique locations taken over a measured period of time, and measured depths from SSA countries including but not exclusively, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia. These samples were provided by seven different agencies. Nutrients observed included for example organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and extractable: phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) etc. Macro nutrients and micro nutrients were Observed. ~ For model fitting and prediction the researchers used Random Forest and Gradient Bosting Tree Machine Learning Methods. ~It was found that nutrients S, P, and B tended to be more difficult to model spatially using their framework. But significant models CAN be produced for most targeted nutrients. And maps of micro/macro nutrients could be used to mark areas of nutrient deficiency and sufficiency with a view to cropping and nutrient adjustments. Cluster analysis showed that there was potential for creating 20 zones in SSA requiring similar nutrient management.  ~Some areas in the SSA area were under-represented in terms of soil samples. Collection of more samples from these areas would go towards improving prediction accuracy.

These are Agent, Brain and Academy. These three objects work together to improve the intelligence of the agents. ~Unity agents have a variety of possible scenarios which depend on how agents, brains and rewards are connected. A single agent is linked to a single brain and is the traditional way of training an agent. An example is any single-player game, such as Chicken. A Simultaneous Single-Agent consists of multiple independent agents with independent reward functions linked to a single brain. An example would be training a dozen robot-arms to each open a door simultaneously. Adversarial Self-Play contains two interacting agents with inverse reward functions linked to a single brain. A Cooperative Multi-Agent has multiple agents with a shared reward function, linked to either a single or multiple different brains. A Competitive Multi-Agent has multiple interacting agents with inverse reward funcion linked to either a single or multiple different brains. And finally, an Ecosystem which has multiple interacting agents with independent reward functions linked to either a single brain or multiple different brains. ~With the release of this open beta SDK, Unity has provided developers and researchers with the abilty to transform games and simulations created using the Unity Editor into environments where intelligent agents can be trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Strategies, or other machine learning methods through a simple to use Python API. ~I feel this beta is a fantastic release from Unity as it provides researchers and developers with a very powerful tool in the form of open-source software, as well as examples to get them started with machine learning in research and game development.

These playlists are personal to each of Spotify's over 100 million users. ~Spotify uses implicit feedback (specifically stream counts of tracks listened to) as well as additional streaming data such as saved tracks or if the artist page was visited after listening. They also use track metadata, news articles, blogs, and other text around the internet as well as raw audio data. ~Ciocca researched Spotify's three types of recommendation models which are employed by the company: Collaborative Filtering, Natural Language processing and Raw Audio Models. With Collaborative Filtering, Spotify uses a matrix to represent users as well as songs. Using a matrix factorization formula, the matrix can split users and songs into seperate vectors, which can then be compared to with each other to find similarities. With Natural language processing, Spotify crawls the web for written texts about music and figures out what is being said about particular artistsand songs. Again this data is stored in vectors for comparison. With Raw Audio Models, spotify uses convolutional neural networks to compute statistics of the learned features across the time of the song. This data allows for even more comparison for similarities in songs. ~By combining these three models, Spotify is able to create a uniquely powerful discovery engine, which can ultimately recommend new music to their users which has a higher accuracy of being enjoyed by that user on a personal level. ~I think this is a great approach by Spotify, as it creates the feeling of a personal touch, with care provided to each of its users, which in turn will keep them loyal and subscribed to the service.

ML will lead businesses into environs with minimum human error and stronger cyber security.ML will completely enable new interactions between customers and companies and eventually allow true intelligent enterprise. Most of the global enterprises have cantered their corporate strategy on digital transformation.  Machine learning is a major part of this transformation. Applications, Algorithms and frameworks learn from a huge amount of structured and unstructured data such as Text, image, video, voice, body language and facial expression.  This creates room for a wider dimension of applications and algorithms ranging from healthcare to video games and self driving cars.  ~Enterprises use historical data within their coppany to train and algorithms and predict future outcomes. ~While machines can automate lengthy and repetitive tasks, they can also be used to predict the outcome of new data.  This predicted data is used to make decisions. Companies rely on these predictions to advance their businesses and reduce the risk taken in decision making as it minimises human error.  Prediction algorithms rely heavily on behaviour signals.  The more the user shares with the algorithm the better the prediction becomes, one example is streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon prime where, depending on the users behaviour, the platform can recommend and advertise content.  These algorithms define a strategy to drive desired sales and market outcomes. Business processes will also become automated and as the business changes these algorithms will constantly update and adapt themselves. These business processes range across a wide spectrum of contract management, customer service, finance, legal, quality assurance, pricing and production.  ~ML in is changing enterprises for the better according to most companies who are applying machine learning to sales and marketing.  With machine learning, companies are gaining a greater predictive accuracy.  According to the Accenture institute of higher performance, 76% of the companies that use machine learning claimed to be targeting a higher sales growth. ~with the increase in the use of machine learning within enterprises, a rise in competition between the companies is also present. This forces companies to consider advancing their technologies to increase sales as well as predict future outcomes.

Instead of uploading the photos the person takes online to a server for processing, with the use of CoreML, runs the algorithms on your phone. CoreML was announced by Apple. The image is analysed on the phone and never has to go to the cloud. The model is an identification neural network and with it, it is trained by researchers at VisualDx, using their own library of medical images.   ~The result of this is that doctors can use this to confirm and validate diagnoses, as well as allow doctors to search symptoms, signs, and other patients' factors.  ~An interesting comment from the CEO of VisualDx, Art Papier, was how he said that  automatic diagnosis wasn't going to happen soon, even considering the achievements they made with these models and applications of Core ML and their app. He said that the "hype circle" of machine learning is "off the charts" and how it'll take a lot more to get there. Papier said "Machine learning will get you into a category on this, to get to the final mile, you have to ask the patient did you take a drug a week ago. Did you travel".

This neural network is fed all the available pictures of the user to generate a set of values corresponding to that person, these are then used to identify these people in other pictures that their friends perhaps may have shared. ~ The neural network was remakably successful being regarded as one of the most advanced image recognition tools beating humans in extensive testing where the goal was to discern if 2 different images are of the same person. The success rate for DeepFace was 97% and the success rate for humans was 96% ~ This was a very successful bit of software but it got removed in 2013 from European accounts due to issues with infringing on privacy where people argued that with high level images of a crowd DeepFace could start putting names to faces it can see.

METHOD The method wasn't explicitly explained, only mentioning on their website that they used different AI algorithms to generate visual content merging image styles with real-life images and content.  The software detects faces and other patterns in images and classifying them. The method of running it in reverse after being trained resembles back propagation optimisation but instead of adjusting the weight heights, the values don't change but the input is adjusted. Also with the use of gradient descent, may result in the input producing "images in which adjacent images have little relation [...] thus the image has too much high frequency information". This is solved with the use of a "regulariser" which chooses inputs that are "simply smooth". All this occurs by adding "dreamed" inputs to the training set and can improve the training times. ~The results are abstract images created by the machine by fusing the images given as input and creating abstract images that were used in apps to allow people to transform their very own images and generate merging content and image styles. ~It is interesting the way machines and software that have been created are challenging us in the very things we see like art and bring a new outlook to the way the mid works and another demonstration of the power of neural networks.

440 ~111 ~Written by Charlotte Hu https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autopilot-ai-artificial-intelligence-unfair-advantage/ ~The agent here is Tesla and its autopilot used in Self driving cars. ~The goal is to have an autopilot that is reliable. A big factor in the way of that is the fact that machines have no moral compass. How can they make snap judgements on what is the best decision in the face of an accident.  ~There is much data used from all areas of driving. From people and objects on the road, gps data, car data like speed etc, data on the weather conditions etc. As tesla has a network of connected cars on the road they are gathering data all the time and looking for ways to improve autopilot with that data and methods in machine learning.  ~Historically Tesla focused on "narrow AI". Narrow AI enables the car to make decisions without driver interference. "The vehicles would increasingly rely on radar as well as ultrasonic technology for sensing and data-gathering to form the basis for Tesla's Autopilot algorithms. A technology that isn't derived from LiDAR, the combination of radar and camera system said to outperform LiDAR especially in adverse weather conditions such as fog". "With the introduction of Autopilot 2.0 and Tesla's 'Vision' system, and billions of miles real-world driving data collected by Model S and Model X drivers, Tesla continues to create a detailed 3D map of the world that has increasingly finer resolution as more vehicles are purchased, delivered and placed onto roadways. The addition of GPS allows Tesla to put together a visual driving map for AI vehicles to follow, paving the path for newer and more advanced vehicles." Apart from the main algorithms that are controlling it I am unaware. They have taken on board Andrej Karpathy as the new Director of Aritificial intelligence at Tesla. That could be considered a method for bringing autopilot to the next level. Karpathy came from Open-AI, Elon Musks non profit AI company.  ~Tesla's autopilot is already capable of self driving and it is only to get better with the use of machine learning. Using ML with their masses of data will greatly improve the performance of the cars autopilot. I would already considered it a success  but the fact still remains on the car having the ability to make moral judgements in the right dangerous situations.  ~Although the autopilot is already at a very advanced stage, it will take a considerable amount of work to get it to a stage were it can make consistant moral judgements in dangerous scenarios, but I fell in it is in the right hands with Tesla and Elon Musk.

A great source of this for Google were things like movie and tv show scripts and the audio from them. This provided them with a near unlimited training set to work on. ~The method employed for this task has evolved over time, starting with a Gaussian Mixture Model and moving onto a multi-layered Deep Neural Network combined with back-propagation. The first layer in the network chops up an audio and identifies vowel sounds. The subsequent layers work to figure out how vowel sounds might be combined to form words. Whenever the neural network misidentifies a word the system back-propagates, adjusting the weights throughout the inner layers of the neural network in order for it to correctly identify the audio on the next occasion. Google then moved onto using Recurrent Neural Networks for the task, which in addition to the functionality of a Deep Neural Network have the ability to remember what they have heard so far, much like humans recognise speech based largely on what has already been said.   ~When Google first released their Voice Transcription onto the public market in 2011, the error rate was around 25%. Over the next six years changes to the types of neural networks used as well as more data being available to Googles models has led to that error rate being reduced to under 8%. ~One of Googles greatest challenges was correct punctuation. Punctuation and how it is used varies greatly across languages and very subtle differences in speech emphasis can completely change the meaning of speech and with it the correct punctuation. A big breakthrough came with Googles use of Recurrent Neural Networks which gave Googles models context, greatly assisting in the determination of correct pronunciation.

It claims to be a more intuitive and secure way to authenticate a user. ~ Face ID's goal is to provide a secure means of unlocking your iPhone. It can also be used for purchasing items from iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and for payments with Apple Pay, and to sign in to applications. ~ The application uses learning algorithms to learn the users features over time. "The TrueDepth camera captures accurate face data by projecting and analyzing over 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of your face and also captures an infrared image of your face. A portion of the A11 Bionic chip's neural engine — protected within the Secure Enclave — transforms the depth map and infrared image into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data." ~ The authentication method reacts to changes in appearances. If a change is too great there is an option for authentication by using a passcode before updating changes to the users appearance.  The application is triggered when the iPhone screen is tapped, when a notification wakes the screen, or when the iPhone is raised. There are additional security measures including extra validation if the iPhone has not been unlocked in 24 hours and if the iPhone in question has been unlocked remotely.  ~ During the first public demonstration of Face ID there was a slight mishap; the iPhone would not unlock using face recognition. The iPhone in question had been handled by a multiple of people before setting up for a live demonstration by Craig Ferderighi.  ~ Apple claim that the “Face ID worked as it was designed to” as it required a passcode to unlock. What worries me is that it was possible for the faces of others to influence this at all (and apparently without their knowledge during their handling of the iPhone).

Researchers:  Babak Saleh, Ahmed Elgammal Rutgers University in New Jersey ~Classifying fine art normally involves finding out who the artist is, the style used, the genre, age of the painting and recognising influences between artists.  This can be a difficult task, identifying influences can be particularly difficult and usually requires art experts to do the work.  The goal was to create an algorithm that would carry out the task of classifying paintings and identifying influences between artists ~The data they used came from a large database of digitised images of paintings by more than a thousand artists.  The images had been catagorised according to styles and genre.  For their training set they used over 1700 paintings ranging from the 15th to the 20th century and painted by 66 different artists in 13 different styles.  ~The algorithm used machine learning and machine vision.   The images of the paintings where broken down into over 2500 classemes.  Classemes are classifiers describing features such as colour, form, shape, type of object (eg a swan, swimmer, body of water, etc) The result was a vector like list of words describing the painting.  The paintings were then compared by looking for similar vectors ~Opinions from experts on paintings and artists who had be influenced by others were gathered and used to measure their results.  The algorithm used was able to correctly identify the artist in 60% of cases and the style in 45%.  The algorithm was also found to be able to identify paintings that had been influenced by other paintings.  Using the algorithm, they discovered influences between paintings that had not previously been recognised by art historians.  ~The researchers say that a refinement of the same method could also be used for other types art e.g. music or literature.

Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network - MLP 29 is a non-linear feed-forward network model which maps a set of inputs x onto a set of outputs y using multi weights connections. Bayesian Network - A BN 26 is a probabilistic graphical model for reasoning under uncertainty, where the nodes represent discrete or continuous variables and the links represent the relationships between them. Decision Tree - DT 39 decides the target class of a new sample based on selected features from available data using the concept of information entropy. The nodes of the tree are the attributes, each branch of the tree represents a possible decision and the end nodes or leaves are the classes. Random Forest - RF 13 works by constructing multiple decision trees on various sub-samples of the datasets and output the class that appear most often or mean predictions of the decision trees. Nave Bayes - The Nave Bayes 41 classifier is a classification algorithm based on Bayes theorem with strong independent assumptions between features. K-nearest Neighbour - KNN 2 is an instance-based learning algorithm that store all available data points and classifies the new data points based on similarity measure such as distance. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) - The weights of incorrectly labelled data points are adjusted in AdaBoost such that the following classifiers focus more on incorrectly labelled or difficult cases 24. LogitBoost - LogitBoost 25 is actually an extension of AdaBoost where it applies the cost function logistic regression to AdaBoost, thus it classifies by using a regression scheme as base learner. Real AdaBoost - Unlike most Boosting algorithms which returns binary valued classes (Discrete AdaBoost), Real AdaBoost 42 outputs a real valued probability of the class. Bagging - Bagging 12 is a method by generating several training sets of the same size and use the same machine learning algorithm to build model of them and combine the predictions by averaging. It is often improve the accuracy and stability of the classifier. Dagging - Dagging 45 generates a number of disjoint and stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the machine learning classifier. Majority vote is done for predictions since all the generated machine learning classifier are put into the voted Meta classifier. Dagging is useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behaviour on the number of instances in the training data. Rotation Forest - The rotation forest 40 is constructed using a number of the same machine learning classifier typically decision tree independently and trained on a new set of trained features form by sub-sampling of the datasets with principal component analysis applied on each sub-sets. ~Web Spam detection is also known as binary classification problem (spam or non-spam), thus the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is used as evaluation metrics. The receiver characteristic curve is determined by plotting true positive rate vs the false positive rate in various threshold value. AUC is a measure for accuracy and also a performance metric for logistic regression. Most algorithms performed well with the idnedifcation of spam, with a rate of between 60% and 80%, however  random forest has outperform other classifiers including SVM which widely used in Web spam community as much as  0.927 in WEBSPAM-UK2006 and 0.850 in WEBSPAM-UK2007 AUC ~Since this study was performed, google has taken more steps to ensure the proper filteration of spam, and claims that Gmail can correctly detect 99% of all spam emails

412 ~104 ~https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11829678/google-magenta-melody-art-generative-artificial-intelligence ~The agent here is Google. ~The goal is to use machine learning techniques in order to teach a system on how to compose a piece of music, and on a deeper level to advance the state of the art in machine intelligence for music and art generation. Google also hope to build a community of artists, coders and machine learning researchers. The system collected is called Magenta. ~Magenta uses the NSynth Dataset. NSynth is an audio dataset containing 305,979 musical notes, each with a unique pitch, timbre, and envelope.For 1,006 instruments from commercial sample libraries, Google generated four second, monophonic 16kHz audio snippets, referred to as notes, by ranging over every pitch of a standard MIDI pian o (21-108) as well as five different velocities (25, 50, 75, 100, 127).  ~Magenta is build upon Google's own TensorFlow system. The NSynth (Neural Audio Synthesis) algorithm was used in this project, googles own new approach to synthesis using neural networks. NSynth works by finding a compressed representation of sound(we will call Gamma). An encoder network transformers a sound into is Gamma representation. A decoder network then converts it back to sound. The system is trained in such a way that the reproduced sound is as similar as possible to the real sound.  ~While regularly we could measure likelihood for the success of similar machine learning projects, this cannot be applied as comprehensively to music and art due to their inherently subjective nature. On the note of this subjective nature, I believe Magenta has produced fantastic results in terms of some of the music it has produced. The amount of articles concerning and even YouTube recordings of Magentas efforts further this point.  ~ I think this is an extrodinary project when mapped over time. Some examples of the music produced by Magenta are quite honestly poor, however there are more advanced demos that are extraordinary. It was once said that as advanced computers could be, they could not be artistic or creative. Projects like magenta shatter this idea - and even still are in their relative infancy. It would be interesting to see what this amount to in, say, 20 years time. Will we be attending concerts and festivals headed by famous composer-algorithms? Will these endeavours eventually produce music so high quality that human beings cannot create something better? With more research and advancements, this sort of application of Machine Learning has the potential to be game-changing for the music scene.

The system was then then tested on data from 140 patients. ~The system has two main steps: a supervised machine learning step where the computer creates a probability map for the target classes, and a second step where they combine these probabilities with a biophysical model that represents how tumors grow in mathematical terms, which imposes limits on the analyses and helps find correlations. ~Biros and his team were able to run their analysis pipeline on 140 brains in less than 4 hours and correctly characterized the testing data with nearly 90 percent accuracy, which is comparable to human radiologists. ~The methods that the team developed go beyond brain tumour identification.

When given a 2D picture representation of anything the application should be able to find the main object in the picture and cut out any background surrounding it. ~The most common datasets for segmentation were the COCO dataset, which includes  around 80K images with 90 categories, the VOC pascal dataset with 11K images and  20 classes, and the newer ADE20K datasets. The COCO dataset was chosen as the main source of data since it includes  much more images with the class “person” which was our class of interest. ~The model was trained with a schedule: standard cross  entropy loss, RMSProp optimizer with 1e-3 learning rate and small decay. The 11,000 images were split into 70% training, 20% validation, 10% test.  To keep to the training schedule aligned with the original paper, the epoch size was set on 500 images. This also allowed the model to be saved periodically with every improvement in results,  Additionally, the model was trained on only 2 classes: background and person. ~The results show a IoU value of 84.6 on the test set, while current state of the art is 85.  That number fluctuates throughout different datasets and classes.  There are classes which are inherently easier to segment e.g houses, roads, where most models  easily reach results of 90 IoU. Other more challenging classes are trees and humans,  on which most models reach results of around 60 IoU. ~

The official website boasts that it can "transform your face using artificial intelligence with just one tap". The application allows the user to alter images to add a smile, change gender, look older, look younger and look "more attractive". The latter being the most controversial of all the filters. ~ FaceApp uses a combination of its own training data and open-source libraries including TensorFlow. Goncharov has been recorded as admitting that the training data for determining desirability was the company's own training data.  He has admitted that the training data had biases. "We are deeply sorry for this unquestionably serious issue. It is an unfortunate side-effect of the underlying neural network caused by the training set bias, not intended behaviour." ~ The applications used a combination of machine learning algorithms alongside photo editing algorithms. ~ The application received feedback from users stating that it was "racist" when it came to determining how "hotness" should be characterised. When used by black people, the filter automatically brightened the users' skin tone. The companies first relabelled the filter to "spark" instead of its previous name "hotness", and then later removed the filter completely. Wireless Lab claim to be currently working on a fix for this filter. COMMENT I don't feel that Wire Lab immediately learned and grew from their negative publicity due to other controversies regarding claims of racism. The application also offered a Bob Marley filter, which transformed users' skin tones. This filter was offered alongside similar filters that changes skin tones according to certain ethnicities (these filters were later removed). Regardless of how it is handled, there will always be sensitivity around topics that reference skin colour or ethnicity. Perhaps the filters would have been more successful if user's were presented with a sort-of dial or gradient, where users' could choose their own colour for skin tone instead of predefined categories. This would provide options for both realistic and unrealistic skin tones alike, thus implying neutrality.

A privately owned Space company who has Elon Musk as it's CEO. It is not limited to this but most of the paper is discussing the Falcon 9 Rocket so that can also be considered the agent. ~ To improve the uncertainty involved when landing a spacecraft. In the past NASAs Pathfinder that was sent to Mars, had an uncertainty of 150 kilometers around its final landing destination. "In 1997, when NASA sent a rover called Mars Pathfinder to the red planet, it was expected to land within an ellipse 150 kilometers across its major axis, which is not exactly what you want to hear if you're scientist with a specific destination in mind." The main reason for this was because of the use of parachutes to come slow down the craft prior to landing. The goal of Space X is to use rocket thrust to control its descent as well as teaching the rocket to fly itself down. "But once the physics are mastered of maneuvering a rocket-powered spacecraft in for landing, the rocket still needs to be taught to fly itself down."  ~The vehicle uses masses of data. The majority of which is related to the crafts orientation, location, speed, amount of fuel, landing target, destination atmosphere and many other important factors used to succesfully land the F9R. It must compute a divert trajectory and it is imperative that it does this in a fraction of a second. "The vehicle must compute  a  divert  trajectory  from  its  current  location  to  the target, ending at rest and in a good orientation for landing without exceeding the capabilities of the hardware. The  computation  must  be  done  autonomously,  in  a  fraction of a second. Failure to find a feasible solution in time will crash the spacecraft into the ground. Failure to find the optimal solution may use up the available propellant, with the same result." ~"SpaceX uses CVXGEN (Mattingley and  Boyd  2012)  to  generate  customized  flight  code, which  enables  very  highspeed onboard convex optimization." Blackmore and his colleagues are responsible for developing one of the first algorithms to calculate in real time what is needed to land the craft in three dimensions. "He and his colleagues developed one of the first algorithms to do this in three dimensions in that 2009 paper on Mars landings, receiving a patent on their ideas in 2013.The solution involves solving a 'convex optimization problem' a common challenge in modern machine learning". "At SpaceX, Blackmore and his team have updated the landing algorithms, using software developed by Stanford computer scientists'to generate customized flight code, which enables very high speed onboard convex optimization.' As the rocket reacts to changes in the environment that alter its course-known as "dispersions" - the on-board computers recalculate its trajectory to ensure that it will still be 99% sure to land within its target." ~The results have been very successful, in the beginning the first couple of attempts were unsuccessful but they have improved greatly. "So far, it has: SpaceX has landed eight boosters since its first successful attempt in December 2015, including its last four flights. The three failures to land in that time period were caused by hardware issues, not a failure to navigate successfully to the landing area. SpaceX executives are reluctant to say they now expect landings to succeed, preferring to keep their focus on the primary mission of launching cargo for clients, but it's clear that reliability is improving." ~I am genuinely very excited by this. Space X and other companies like Blue Origin are putting the work in place for Humanity to become an interplanetary species. The work they do is facisinating at Space X in particular is fascinating and they seem to be solving major industry problems with high level concepts that can be made seem simple. i.e. reusing space crafts. The future is bright while we have great minds like these providing us with exciting technology enhancements.

Each entry in the data set featured thousands of variables in order to better model the complex relationships that exist between different elements of the brain. The data collected was at high anatomical resolution. This was viewed as advantageous when compared to current markers investigated for this task, which research felt ignores many crucial variables in determining the impact of a given drug. ~The method employed was a the building of a transductive linear support vector machine classifier with k-fold cross validation to test accuracy. A support vector machine works with numerical data of n dimensions (a dimension for each feature of the data). It separates the data using a line, plane or hyperplane of n-1 dimensions and in this way classifies the data into categories. The parameters of the separating plane are adjusted at each iteration during supervised learning to minimise the classification error. K-fold cross validation involves dividing a test set into k disjoint subsets. At each iteration, train the model over k-1 of these subsets and then test the model on the remaining subset. Change the excluded subset at each iteration.   ~The researchers were able to determine with greater sensitivity the impact of a certain drug on the brain. For example, in the case of lesion reduction, conventional models would need to see a reduction in lesion size of over 78% for the effect of a drug to be detected. In the case of the SVM implemented by researchers, it was successful in determining a positive impact of a drug with just 55% volume shrinkage of a lesion.  ~Researchers feel that machine learning models are far more effective in modeling the brain when compared to statistical models as such models will never come close to replicating the complication of the human brain. For this reason, many results observed using statistical methods when tested on more simplistic animal brains do not hold when the same tests are applied to human brains.

It helps those builders more easily analyse and optimise their bots for better consumer experiences than ever before. ChatBase is free to use, easily integrates with any chatbot platform, and works with any type of bot, voice or text. Built by area 120, a workshop home to Google's experimental products.  ~The way ChatBase collects data is that it integrates with voice, text or messaging apps like WhatsApp, and look through users' messages to get the data. METHOD The method is used involves clustering. Instead of looking through log files to find patterns in user messages, the system uses clustering for the user's messages, allowing to answer more requests. An application of this clustering found success in Rakuten's "Viber". "We increase the query volume by 35% [...] by optimising queries with high exit rates". By relying on the machine learning to help with the "required optimisations" saving time to build new features. Ultimately ChatBase can handle poorly handled messages with the use of clustering mainly. Also with the use of of conversations it creates a visualisation of flow to improve conversion rates. ~With the use of clustering, the ChatBase app results in giving the clients a more optimised solution to answering more requests and also with these tools, the users can figure exactly where the problem with the bot by identifying and clustering problems, as well as saving time on bot analysis. The main result being that messages can be handled better and so provide a better service to customers and improve the user experience for both bot builders and its consumers, ultimately increasing sales of the bot builders. ~N/A.

278 ~81 ~ https://www.rtinsights.com/netflix-recommendations-machine-learning-algorithms/ ~ NETFLIX ~ Provide users with a continuing supply of recomendations ~ What each user watches, when each user watches things, the place on the Netflix screen the customer found the video, the recomendations the user didn't choose and the popularity of the videos in teh catalog. ~ Several algorithms were used in all in both supervised: classification and regression, and unsupervised: dimensionality reduction through clustering and compression. A video-to-video similarity algorithm is used to generated the suggestions in one of the homescreen rows. This is a form of collaborative filtering but instead of matching users it matches the videos. The algorithm matches watched videos to similar videos and builds a list from these items. It then constructs a table by analysing the videos the user watched and combinin this with data on videos often watched together. This is combined with a Persionalized video ranker algorithm, this algorithm is used to set the order of the videos as they appear in the rows. The closer a video is to the first position increases it's likelyhood of being played however this system is best when also combined with unpersonalized popularity data. ~ Netflix manages to provide highly accurate and relevant recomendations to the user. The video-to-video system is reasonably efficient as most of the computation can be done before and only 1 user must be calculated each time as the table of videos watched together is pre-existing. ~ Quite a good example of strong machine learning as Netflix's entire business model relies on users continually watching more and more videos and seeing as Netflix is incredibly successful we can say that these algorithms definitley work very well.

Algorithmia started out at as an online marketplace for algorithms, most of which were focused on Machine Learning (examples include face detection, sentiment analysis, etc.). With Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence finding popularity, Algorithmia is launching a new service that will help users to manage and deploy Machine Learning models and to share them easily with others.  GOALS The goal of Algorithmia is to try and turn some of the infrastructure and services it has to run Machine Learning models into a new product.  The co-founder and CTO of Algorithmia stated that usually, R&D spends time collecting and organising data and then building models with that information. He states that Algorithmia instead spent the last five years building an infrastructure that would put the models found by R&D to use.  ~With Algorithmia's new service, data scientist can create models with languages and frameworks of their choice and can host them on the Algorithmia cloud.  ~To create models, Algorithmia offers two services, the Serverless AI Layer and Enterprise AI Layer for hosting the sevice in any public or private cloud. Both versions of the software offer the ability to use got to add the models, to share the models and to handle permissions and authorization. ~According to Katie Gray, Principal of Investments at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's investment arm, Algorithmia has empowered the U.S. government agencies the capability to deply to the AI layer. She stated that Algorithmia delivered a secure, scalable and discoverable platform in which data scientist could focus on problem solving. Algorithmia also announced a $10.5 million funding round led by Google's new AI venture. ~Its impressive how Algorithmia has delivered a platform that uses more than just R&D and actually delivers machine models for data scientists to use.

The network learned how to map a face from pixels to 3D coordinates, and essentially works with any picture of a face. It can predict the coordinates of the 3D vertices based on the given 2D image. These reconstructions can be further improved by incorporating 3D facial landmark localizations. ~The outcome of this is a 3D facial model which can work with arbitrary facial poses and expressions as well as lighting issues. This AI can reconstruct an entire face, even adding in parts that might not have been visible in the 2D photo. ~I think this can be a fun experiment to work and play around with using personal images.

Tadlock, PharmD, MBA ~This study focused the power of modern analytics on hereditary angioedema (HAE), a single rare disease, because it exhibits features of diseases associated with high costs: rare, hard to diagnose, progressive, and takes a long time from diagnosis to appropriate treatment. Despite the availability of effective therapies, misdiagnoses and underdiagnosis of HAE result in significant burden to the healthcare system.  ~The population for this analysis was extracted from a database of de-identified patient claims data acquired from Truven Health Analytics (MarketScan claims data). This claims database contains health insurance claims data for more than 170 million unique lives covering 2006 through 2014. A 3-stage process was employed to discover patients with HAE within this database who had not been diagnosed. ~The 3-stage process consisted of: identifying people who have been diagnosed with HAE, identify which features or combination of features are most statistically relevant for differentiating HAE from non-HAE patients, and finally use a predictive model to score undiagnosed patients. This score represented the likelihood that the patient had undiagnosed HAE, and patients were ranked from most likely to least likely to have the condition. No description of the model was provided. ~This study successfully demonstrated the ability of this state-of-the-art predictive analysis to find rare-disease patients in a large and complex database. This information could be valuable to claims managers and employers who may realize savings by helping physicians bring these patients to appropriate treatment sooner.  ~

The machine should be able to make judgements related to aestehtics on a semantic level. ~Elgammal and Saleh used the 'Wikiart paintings' dataset set, which comprises 81,449 fine-art paintings from 1,119 artists across fifteen centuries. Within this are contained 27 different styles, and 45 genres.  ~Three methodologies were used: Metric Learning, Feature Fusion, and Metric-Fusion. Metric Learning finds some pair-wise real-value function which is non-negative, symmetric, obeys the triangle inequality, and returns zero if and only if x and x-prime are the same point. Neighborhood Component Analysis, Large Margin Nearest Neighbor, Boost Metric, Information Theory Metric Learning, and Metric Learning for Kernel Regression are also used. These algorithms work together to highlight certain features in a given art piece - these can be low-level features such as overall colour, and more advanced features such as image identity - maybe a horse or a table in the piece. This produces a description of the painting with 400 different dimensions. ~When the method is complete, it is tested on a set of paintings it has not yet seen. This can accurately identify the artist in voer 60% of the paintings, and the style in 45% of them. It also some produces some perhaps unexpected results. In one example it has difficulty distinguishing between the works of Pissarro and Monet. However, these two artists were close friends with many shared experiences, so would have produced similar pieces at a level of detail the human eye may not pick up on immediately. It tends to find links between some styles such as expressionism and fauvism - the latter is a subgenre of expressionism. Links such as these are known by art historians but perhaps not to most pedestarian art consumers - however the algorithms picked up on it.  ~ This an extraordinary use of Machine Learning methods and one not many could think of off-hand. Art seems to be a big draw for Machine Learning research, another project that comes to mind is one of Tubingen, Germany, where researchers have developed an algorithm that morphs any given photo to resemble the style of one of the 'great masters' of art.

Each layer of units can be understood as a collection of image filters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image. Each style of painting was tested indivudially, that was a certain style could be analysed before the agent attempted to recreated a paiting in this style. The researchers taught the system to see how different artists used color, shape, lines, and brushstrokes so that it could reinterpret regular images in the style of those artists. ~The key finding of the paper is that the representations of content and style in the Convolutional Neural Network are separable. That is, you can manipulate both representations independently to produce new, perceptually meaningful images. To demonstrate this finding, they generate images that mix the content and style representation from two different source images. In particular, they could match the content representation of a photograph depicting the Neckarfront in Tubingen, Germany and the style representations of several well-known artworks taken from ¨ different periods of art. ~This study shows how well a machine can interpret a specific artists style, in such a degree that it can create a combination of that style and others if it was instructed to.

The chat-bots current biography reads 'The official account of Tay, Microsoft's A.I. fam from the internet that's got zero chill! The more you talk the smarter Tay gets.' Tay was intended to mimic the language patterns of it's target audience (18 to 24 year old Americans). Thus functionality such as creating memes from users' photographs was entrusted to it. ~ Tay had been modelled after Xiaoice; a chat-bot that had previously been released into the Chinese community through Weibo. Both Xiaoice and Tay learned from interactions through social media, however the integration of the Western chat-box proved less successful. ~ Tay uses machine learning algorithms to learn from the mannerisms of its correspondents. ~ Soon after its release, Tay began to tweet politically incorrect posts that mimicked the tweets that it had been receiving. This resulted in the accounts first suspension, 16 hours after its release . The decision was probably made because of the bad publicity and general uproar in the public realm. Microsoft issued an apology for the inappropriate tweets made by the chat-bot.  Tay was "accidentally" re-released on 30 March, 2016; tweeting yet more politically incorrect posts. ~ Personally I think that Tay was successful in achieving what the chat-bots goal was (to learn from interactions with users in social media). No news is bad news, and however "bad" the publicity was surrounding the endeavours of Tay, it was publicity all the same. What this has really shown is the differences between Eastern and Western cultures (or perhaps it is a display of censorship). There was no claim of Tay being the perfect and proper chat-bot; the claims made by Microsoft were that Tay would become "smarter" the more it is interacted with.  Tay certainly learned how to interact with others through how it itself was interacted with. There was no topic blacklisted by Microsoft's developers. This decision has been commented on as an oversight by members of the public. I ask the question: Was it really an oversight?

It had a link to the blog by Trapit Bansl, Igor Mordatch, Jakub Pachocki, Ilya Sutskever and Szymon Sidor. https://blog.openai.com/competitive-self-play/ ~The agent here is OpenAI and their "Competitive Self Play" model. ~The goal here is to have various versions of the agent train and learn by playing against eachother competitively and without the need of human designed tasks and environments. The reason they want to move away from the need of human intervention is because "the agents' behaviours will be bounded in complexity by the problems that the human designer can pose for them". By using the "Competitive Self Play" model they can develop the agents much faster and more successfully. " By developing agents through thousands of iterations of matches against successively better versions of themselves, we can create AI systems that successively bootstrap their own performance; we saw a similar phenomenon in our Dota 2 project, where self-play let us create an RL agent that could beat top human players at a solo version of the e-sport."  ~The data they work off is based off a rewards system each agent is acting on. The also act and react according to their opponent's moves. They create more data as they progress, working off new methods learned. The environments the agents operate in are data and how to win particular games is more data they work off. Their data set is constantly evolving as they learn new skills. ~"Each agents neural network policy is independetly trained with 'Proximal Policy Optimization'". They provide agents with rewards for behaviour which encourage the agents to explore new movements in the beginning."Here we took the dense reward defined in previous work for training a humanoid to walk, removed the term for velocity, added the negative L2 distance from the center of the ring and took this as a dense exploration reward for our sumo agents." They then steadily converge the rewards to zero as the agent improves in favour of rewarding them for winning and negatively for losing. They set the agents up in different scenarios/environments, like sumo wrestling, get by other agents, one defend while the other attempts to score and more. Over time, they begin to learn new skills and strategies. These skills can be transferred to other environments that have not been experienced by the agent. For example the skills learned from sumo wrestling are used to remain standing in a new environment where a wind of different forces is applied to the agent.   ~This seems to have been very succesful in teaching agents new skills without the need of a human designer. It is also very positive in the sense that the skills learned can be used in different scenarios/environments. "We demonstrated the development of highly complex skills in simple environments with simple rewards. In future work,  it would be interesting to conduct larger scale experiments in more complex environments that encourage agents to both compete and cooperate with each other." ~One feels this could be extremely beneficial to the growth of deep learning. The way the team demonstrated how the agents can learn so rapidly while using "Competitive Self Play" is very intriguing and no doubt many others will undertake similar paths when designing their machine learning agents in future.

This data roughly reflects high traffic locations in NY and thus can be a primer for food truck locations. The data set comes in the form of spatial coordinates. ~The machine learning algorithm used was a k-means clustering algorithm, it was used to pinpoint cluster centres within the traffic data. The underlying idea is that a cluster centre generated from this dataset would generate spots on the map that minimize distances between pickup points, indicating locations with ideal points to set up food carts to access the highest number of customers. ~It is interesting to notice that in figure 1 there are significant differences between the cluster centres and the top-ranked points at different times. Main centres of pickups are evident, especially for smaller, fully mobile carts this kind of information could help tell operators where to go to take advantage of Uber customers. There were some forthcomings using the k-means clustering algorithm, the distance is Euclidean and not along the actual roads, so it might be that centres seems close but in reality, it is not. Moreover, this assumes that Uber users are good food truck customers. To test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between Uber pickups and food truck locations, the data was triangulated with food truck location data scraped from Yelp. The article continues talking about the correlation between food truck locations and Uber pickups and how indicating locations with ideal points to set up food carts could lead to accessing the highest number of customers. ~An analysis such as this is very powerful and effective, it shows how app data from sources such as Uber could be used to inform seemingly unrelated businesses, showing the potential to incorporate external data sources in addition to internal ones. K-means clustering algorithm is definitely effective is such cases.

Hence, millions of colored images were used as a training set. ~A feed-forward convoluted Neural Network was used. The training set consisted of millions of colorized photos. These were grayscaled and sent in as an input to the FFNN, and trained on the original colorised version as an output. This is a form of supervised machine learning. 8 layers were used in the FNN. This form of deep machine learning is necessary. The first layer determines an overall estimate of the scene and its appropriate colors. As the Neural net gets deeper more specific colors are applied to individual objects. ~20 percent of the photo pairs actually fooled the humans. This means the colorized versions were guessed as the real color photos. This fool rate is much higher than prior research in this area. ~As this becomes more efficient, the algorithm can be applied to frames to create colorized videos. At this moment it costs about 2000 euro per minute to colorize a video.

A small speech recogniser runs constantly inside an apple device and is constantly listening to user speech and trying to detect if the user has said hey siri or not. The acoustic model is trained on utterances of Hey Siri that were detected before the automatic Siri activation feature was available. Apple found that many users already said Hey Siri upon starting a conversation with Siri in the traditional way (using buttons) and therefore they had enough samples to train the DNN.  ~The users voice is turned into a series of waveform samples, spectrum analysis then converts the waveform sample stream into a sequence of frames. 20 of these frames (around 20 seconds of audio) are fed into an acoustic model, a deep neural network which converts the speech into a probability distribution over a set of speech sound classes. The DNN is built using standard back-propegation and the gradient descent algorithm to minimise the cost function over iterations.  Temporal integration is then used to determine a confidence score  a 1 would indicate the system is certain that Hey Siri was said while a 0 indicates the opposite certainty. Apple utilised neural network training toolkits like TensorFlow in the process.  ~Success is measured in terms of both False Activation Rate (FAR) and False Reject Rate (FRR). For FAR Apple measures when Siri was triggered unnecessarily and for FRR Apple keeps track of how many times Siri fails to activate when a user says Hey Siri. There is a trade off between the two as a more sensitive model means an increase in FAR and a decrease in FRR. Overall, Apple expects to see an FRR of about 8 per 100 hours and an FAR of 2 per 100 hours.  ~If this confidence score lies above a threshold then the assistant is activated. If on the other hand the confidence score lies between the lower threshold (indicating that hey siri was not said) and the upper threshold (indicating hey siri was said then the phone enters a more sensitive mode, such that Siri is much more likely to be invoked if the user utters the same phrase as before within a few seconds. Apple interprets this to mean that the first attempt by the user was unsuccessful and they wish to try again.

The number is positive if the customer bought or rated the item, the number is negative if the customer disliked or the number would be 0 if the customer has not interacted with the item. There were some variants applied which would add an overall popularity factor to some items. The algorithm would generate it's recommendations by obtaining a similarity value between the current customer and everyone else. This was done by calculating the angles between the vectors. ~ Simple unsophisticated recommendations could be generated for customers using Amazon. ~This would be very computationally intense and popularity factors could easily inflate the results if they weren't regularly update.

The reason for their choice of the former president was justified by the need for at least 14 hours of video to train the neural network.   ~For data processing, the article only refers to the training of a neural network to generate realistic mouth shapes. However, the article displays an image depicting the processing chain as including the use of a recurrent neural network. ~No accuracy assessment of the process was provided in the article. However, the video included in the article which demonstrated the results appeared quite convincing. ~Despite the results appearing quite convincing, this is still no proof of its success as those videos could have been cherry picked by the researchers to overstate their success. The title is also misleading as machine learning not ‘AI’ was employed in the research. The validation for using a former president as a data source being the volume of data is plausible, However, it is likely that he was chosen as it the idea of mimicking the leader of a powerful country would sell in the media.

Researchers: Soumya Sen Gupta and Sai Rajeshwar Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi India  ~The biggest threat to the Right Whale, which is an endangered species, is being hit by ocean vessels or getting caught in fishing nets.  The goal was to develop a system which can identify the call of the whales when they are nearby and so allow vessels to avoid them. ~The data used consisted of 3000 signals of 2 seconds duration from each of two classes: the Right Whale and other whales and creatures. ~The team then used wavelet packet decomposition techniques to find the best features to use to identify the whales calls.  To find the best features to use for classification they used sequential backward selection.  Following this, they used SVM and NaiveBayes classification algorithms to classify the signals.  A 10 fold crossvalidation accuracy test was carried out using both SVM and NaiveBayes to test the algorthims performances. ~The accuracies using SVM ranged from 78% to 90% and those of NaiveBayes ranged from 73% to 86% ~The team did not know a lot about the signals before beginning their work and felt that if they had more information about them beforehand they would have achieved higher accuracies

With this dataset, we can implement at least two versions of MidiNets, one that learns from only the melody channel for fair comparison with MelodyRNN, which does not use chords, and the other that additionally uses chords to condition melody generation,to test the capacity of MidiNet. Both MidiNet  and Google's MelodyRNN created a dataset used specific paramaters, core model, data type, genre specificity as well as mandatory knowledge that the machine had to know before generating any melodies, these were based on priming melody and the music scale and a melody profile. ~Symbolic Representation for Convolution, Generator CNN and Discriminator CNN, Conditioner CNN ~To evaluate the aesthetic quality of the generation result, a user study that involves human listeners was needed. They conducted a study with 21 participants. Ten of whom understand basic music theory and have the experience of being amateur musicians, so they were considered as people with musical backgrounds, the remaining 11 did not have a musical backgrounds at all. Midinet was compared with 3 models realesed by Google Magenta, 100 priming melodies were chosen and each had to create melodies of 8 bars following these primers. The users had to rate the music by 3 metrics, how pleasing, how real, how interesting on a scale of 1 to 5, MelodyRNN used the 3 models lookback RNN, attention RNN and basic RNN , both the lookback RNN and attention RNN outperformed the basic RNN in all 3 metrics and across both groups of users, With MidiNet model 1, this performed alot better than the 3 MelodyRNN models, especially
